<h2>Welcome to ARES</h2>
<div><p>Please fill out the form below selecting an option from the dropdowns. Values are not case-sensitive.</p>
    <p>The first time you run this it will be much slower (about 30 seconds) than it will the second time and in subsequent queries because spark's graphframe requires code generation that runs
    on the first run. On subsequent runs, even with different airports, it will reuse generated code and better utilize cache.

<form id="routeForm">
    <p>The options for origin and destination are populated with all airports available, which includes small regional airports
        that aren't very interesting because there aren't many flights.
        The airport code of larger airports yield more interesting results.
        For example setting  JFK, SEA, ATL, ORD, LAX, MIA, DEN, PHX, PDX etc</p>

        <p>For direct and one layover we only count a delay to be a flight that lands 15 minutes after it was scheduled to land since
            we are more interested in finding airports that have long delays, not a bunch of 5 minute delays since that doesn't really
            affect the traveller</p>

    <h3>Least Delayed Direct</h3>
    <table id="leastDelayedDirect"></table>


    <h3>Least Delayed One Layover</h3>
    <div>
        <p>
            This is ranked as the route that had the lowest percentage of delayed flights for the route
            when calculating the highest average delay for each flight. For example pdx to atl if it has a layover in den.
            It's ranked by the highest percentage of delay for either pdx to den or den to atl.
